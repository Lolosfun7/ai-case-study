# 1. AI in the U.S. Air Force
In this case study I will discuss how the Air force has designeated PANDA (Predictive Analytics and Decision Assistant) and C3 AI, with an objective to enhance fleet availability and lower life cycle costs. 

# 2. Overview and Origin
**United Sates Air Force**
* The US Air Force was established as it's own branch of the U.S. miliatary on September 18,1947.
* The US Air Force was not founded by a single individual, but established by legislation from the National Security Act of 1947.
* General Henry H. Arnold, helped advocate to push for a independant air service, separate from the U.S. Army. 
* The funding for the U.S. Air Force involves severaly steps, including tge federal budget through decsiions made by Congress.

# 3. Business Activities 
* The U.S. Air Force and (GAO) Government Accountability Office, found mulitple aircraft mission-capable deadlines and goals were not being met. 
* Finding a solution or system to identify risk of failure before those issues occurred, was cruicial to these missions.
* The RSO (Rapid Sustainment Office) is responsible for setting a program office to apply Artifical Intelligence and machin learning to advance fleet maitenance, increase aircraft availibility and reduce costs and downtime. 
* The solution identified is C3 AI Platfor and C3 AI Readiness applications through the Air Force Cloud One, powered by AWS. <https://c3.ai/c3-ai-platform/>

* This system will help identify aircraft systems and components at risk of failure, and provide the needed evidence in order to be proactive with maintenance, and conduct availability for the correct parts and correct placement for the maintenance. <https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-readiness/>
* Currently the U.S. Air Force utilizes a mix of advanced technologies to track maintenance, parts and assets, a few examples include RFID tags, data analytics from RFID data, blockchain pilots/supply chain, and even AR in Maintenacne Training. 

# 4. Landscape
* The U.S. Airforce is held with in the field of aerospace and defence.
* This specific feild has had many major trends in the last 5&ndash;10 years including, AI, Cybersecuity, Hypersonic Technologies, Space Militarization, Sustainable Aviation, and Advanced Manufacturing.
*There have been several major companies that operate in this space including top players like Lockehaed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman.

# 5. Results
* This new C3 AI Platform and C3 AI Readiness has provided multiple benefits to the U.S. Airforce. Specifically, this new Platform has enahanced operational readineess and efficency through data analytics and articial intelligence. 
* Key tools with in analytics and AI include, Enhanced Predictive Maintenance, Optimized Supply chain Managament, and most importantly Enhanced Mission Readiness.
* The U.S. Air Force implemented a mix of metrics and KPIs( Key performance indicators). <https://c3.ai/improving-us-air-force-mission-capability-with-ai/#:~:text=PANDA%20generates%20detailed%20CBM%2B%20forecasts,most%20attention%20during%20maintenance%20events.>
* These indicators include multiple Failure and Repair measures, including Mean Time Between Failures and  Mean Time Between Repairs. Beyond these two KPIs there are many others with in Aircraft Avilability and Readiness Metrics. 
* The end goal and result for developing such a platform for the U.S. Airforce, is to enahance the ability to achieve and maintain air superiority, protect national interests, and effectivily counter threats in multiple operational envrionments. 

# 6. Recommendations
* If given the opportunity to advise the U.S. Air Force, I would strongly advocate for investing in technology and artifical intelligence. The ROI in these areas is significant and would yield substantial benefits and outcomes. 
* Allocating the requisite budgets to such software vendors for partnership will not only bolster the fleet but also enable them to achieve their goal of operating most effectively within an efficient timeline.
* C3 AI Platform was designed to integragte with muliple technologies to help develop and deploy the solution. These systems would include, AI, Data Integration, Cloud Computing, DevOps, Cybersecurity, Viscual and User Interface Technologies and Open APIs. 
* The integration of these essential technologies is pivotal to achieving the organization's primary objective. Within these integrated systems and dat platforms, comprehensive technology stacks empower the organization to effectively leverage AI at scale, driving successful digital transformation initiatives.
